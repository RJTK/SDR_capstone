def multipath_channel(x, delay_time, G, fs, debug = False, warn = 0):

  *DOESN'T REALLY WORK*

  Models a multipath channel.  This function creates a delayed version of the 
  signal 'x' by disgarding samples, multiplies by a gain factor G, and adds
  to the original signal.  delay_time & G may both be iterables, this will
  add multiple copies.

  *** Modeling multipath distortion is not an easy task.  The problem is that
  1 sample's worth of time is a long time compared to the speed of light.
  Modeling multipath effects is thus more complicated than just delaying the
  signal by an integral number of samples.  I need a method to shift the
  signal by a fraction of it's sample width.  This can be achieved by massive
  upsampling.  However, this approach is computationally expensive.  Is it
  possible to effectively shift the signal by some small amount, without
  incurring a huge computational cost? ***

  *** Also, it seems a huge amount of extra noise is added somewhere in this
  function.  It is not just a delay... ***

  x: The original signal
  delay_time: A delay time in seconds.  That is, the multipath propagation delay.
    This will probably be on the order of micro seconds or nano seconds.  Light
    takes appx 3ns to travel 1m.  So, roughly 3us to travel 1Km
  G: A gain factor for the multipath.  Must be 0 <= G <= 1
  fs: The sample rate (used to calculate time in seconds)
  warn: If the factor of additional samples is greater than the specified value
    A warning is raised and the user is asked if he wishes to continue.  Use
    warn = -1 to disable.

  *SOME TESTING, BUGGY*

  Implements an all pass filter (flat frequency response).  The plan was to
  generate an all pass filter with a very ugly phase response by generating
  random taps (while maintaining flat frequency response).  However, this does
  not actually do what I hoped it would.  I expected a terribly ugly
  phase response.  However, the phase response of this random IIR filter turns
  out to actually be pretty linear...

  The frequency response seems to also SOMTIMES output some crazy behaviour as 
  the frequency gets close to pi.  Would be wise to use with debug = True.
